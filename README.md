# MOVE+ Whitepaper

Version 1.0 – Sustainable Gamified Fitness Infrastructure (2026)

---

# 1. Executive Summary

Move+ is a gamified fitness platform that converts real-world movement into structured digital rewards.

Users walk, run, or cycle to earn Energy.
NFT holders unlock performance-based advantages through strategic attribute allocation.

Move+ is designed for long-term sustainability — combining Web2 revenue stability with Web3 ownership mechanics.

---

# 2. The Problem

Traditional fitness platforms:

• Provide no ownership

• Monetize attention rather than performance

• Do not reward consistency


Previous move-to-earn models:

• Collapsed due to uncontrolled token emissions

• Encouraged farming instead of fitness

• Relied heavily on inflationary rewards


Move+ addresses these structural weaknesses.

---

# 3. Core System Design

## Base Rules


• All NFTs start at Level 0

• Durability cap: 100 / 100

• Durability cap does not increase

• Level cap: 30

• 1 attribute point per level

• Repair and Upgrade are separate mechanics


Performance improves with strategy, not lifespan.

---

# 4. NFT Structure

Genesis Supply: 5,000 NFTs

Attributes:


• Efficiency → +2% earnings per point

• Comfort → −1.5% energy cost per point

• Resilience → −2% durability loss per point

• Luck → +0.3% bonus chance per point



Cycle NFT Collection:

# 5. Reward Systems

# 6. Revenue Model

Move+ operates on dual revenue infrastructure.

## Web2 Revenue (Permanent)


• In-app advertisements

• Subscription tiers

• Premium feature unlocks


Web2 revenue ensures baseline operational sustainability.

## Web3 Revenue


• Genesis NFT sales (5,000 supply)

• Secondary marketplace royalties

• Future NFT collections (e.g., Cycle NFT)


Revenue diversification reduces dependency on token emissions.

---

# 7. Token Vision (Target: Q2 2026)

Move+ plans to explore a controlled reward token model in Q2 2026.

Token launch is conditional upon:

• Stable user growth

• Verified reward sustainability

• Controlled emission modeling

The token will not precede product validation.

---

# 8. Economic Philosophy

Move+ prioritizes:


• Finite leveling

• Controlled reward scaling

• Anti-farming safeguards

• Movement-based proof

• Gradual expansion

Product first.
Scale second.
Speculation last.
